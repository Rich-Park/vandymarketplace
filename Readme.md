## Repo and Project Overview

Vandy Marketplace is a platform within Vanderbilt University's community that we made to replace the disorganized Vandy Re-Use GroupMe chat. Vandy Marketplace offers a streamlined and user-friendly interface, prioritizing up-to-date listings and efficient item presentation. Users can filter and categorize listings, favorite items, and manage their uploads easily. To ensure authenticity, access is restricted to Vanderbilt affiliates, requiring Vanderbilt email verification. We aim to provide a secure and convenient space for Vanderbilt members to buy and sell used items, improving the overall user experience and fostering a more organized marketplace.
